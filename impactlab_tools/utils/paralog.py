"""System for handling the parallel processing on the file system.

The use case is when we design a job to be able to be run multiple
times on the same server, where the jobs each work on distinct
directories.  Each job "claims" a directory when it begins working on
it and releases the directory when it is done.

We do this for the forecast generation, aggregation, result checking,
and cleanup jobs.

The system should handle situations where the process crashes before
it has released a directory; where we want to kill all processes early
and release their directories; where we want to track down logs for
each output; and where jobs of one kind either can or cannot be run
while jobs of another kind are active.

Usage:

 - Each process instantiates StatusManager, which begins a new log file.

 - When the process begins work in a directory, it calls "claim",
   which attempts to lock the directory and creates a job-specific
   status file, while represents that lock.

 - When the process complete it's work, it calls "release", which
   deletes the job-specific status file, but addes a new status line
   to the cross-job status file.
